def is_valid_cover(solution, vertices):

        A candidate solution S is a valid solution, called Vertex Cover, 
        if each edge in G has at least one endpoint in S. 
        The objective function value Ï‰(S) of a candidate solution S is defined as the sum of the weights of the vertices in S. 
        The objective of the MWVC problem is then to find a valid candidate solution that minimizes the objective function.

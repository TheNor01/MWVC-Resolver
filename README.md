# MWVC-Resolver. Minimum Weighted Vertex Cover problem

In computer science, the problem of finding a minimum vertex cover is a classical optimization problem.

The primary objective is to identify valid and optimal solutions to the MWVC problem. 
This,is achieved through the manipulation of a population of solutions, with the goal of
improve them over time. The genetic approach involves creating new solutions through
the combination and modification of existing solutions. 
This process of evolution continues
until optimal or highly competitive results are achieved.


Genetic Algorithms with some tweaks are used in order to solve MWVC

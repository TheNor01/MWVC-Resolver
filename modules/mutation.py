#Genetic algo implementation


"""

The genetic algorithm uses three main types of rules at each step to create the next generation from the current population:

1)Selection rules select the individuals, called parents, that contribute to the population at the next generation. 
    The selection is generally stochastic, and can depend on the individuals' scores.

2)Crossover rules combine two parents to form children for the next generation.

3)Mutation rules apply random changes to individual parents to form children.


stopping criterion to consider is F E = 2 Ã— 104 as the maximum number for objective
function evaluations. Please, include in the results table also the average
number of objective function evaluations needed for reaching the optimal
solution



i have to create 3 param

Population Size 
crossover probability
mutation probability
